# Foreman

Experimental Kubernetes support for [Foreman](https://theforeman.org) project.

This Helm chart uses the [published Foreman image](https://quay.io/repository/foreman/foreman)and it does not include any additional plugins. If you require more plugins, please rebuild the image yourself.

This by no means is a replacement to the installer or should effect users besides the purpose of getting up an environment quickly
